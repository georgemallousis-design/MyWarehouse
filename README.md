# MyWarehouse

A simple warehouse management project used for experimentation and
teaching purposes. The codebase includes:

* A lightweight SQLite database layer for storing customers, materials
  and serial numbers.
* Import/export helpers for working with CSV and Excel files.
* A categorisation module that can guess the type of a material based on
  its name and description.
* Basic Tkinter based GUI components for managing warehouse data.

## Development

The project uses standard Python tooling. To run the test suite execute:

```bash
pytest
```

Feel free to open issues or pull requests with improvements.
